That is the quote that was used to promote the Dark Tower movie and, as a fan, it was hella captivating. The idea that the cycle at the ending of the series of books was finally going to be broken was something that got me hyped up for the book. That and Idris Elba and Matthew Mcconaughey. Honestly this could've been the best series (mini-series at least!) in TV/streaming, but alas, SK is also destined to try and fail one more time to have a good series/movie. "Last time around", hopefully.

But I digress, I wanted to focus more on the books and why they are *so* good. During this pandemic I've been caught in the daily life and in a lot more problems and day-to-day and I haven't been able to read as much as I would have liked. I keep buying books and updating my "to-read" list, but I haven't been reading **anything**. I used to read a lot of books before, and if something piqued my interest I would burn my candles on both end (Fun fact: I've never read by candlelight). 

The fact that I've not read as much is sad because SK keeps writing and adding more books to my list. I have to admit that he's the reason why I have read so much, why I started to like reading in the first place. There is just something about his way of writing that captures me entirely and doesn't let go, even if I'm kicking and screaming and scared sh*tless. I just cannot stop reading.

I like reading King's books and have noticed patterns and motifs in his stories. There are a lot that I could talk about but the focus of this post is to talk about how many stories link back to the Dark Tower. After reading that book I've gone back (and forwards) to read more book by the master himself and I see it everywhere. Every story he tells, every villain that he has written about, it's ALL RELATED. Everything has to do with the *Ka* and an imbalance in it. It's the fuel for every of his fiction stories and the main driver of the plot. That's my theory.

Everything is in the same universe and it's amazing and engrossing. I cannot stop reading his books once I start and I cannot stop coming up with new theories about how Roland could save the day and how that would solve Carrie's teen problems. Everything is related and I love it. 

By the way, don't watch this movie if you are not a fan of the Dark Tower otherwise you'll hate it. In fact, even if you are a fan of the series you'll most likely also be livid at what they did with the story. Anyways, it's back to 'Salem's Lot for me and I'll let you know how it's related to the Dark Tower.
